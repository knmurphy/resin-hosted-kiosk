Loosely based on https://bitbucket.org/lifeeth/resin-kiosk.git

##Installing

Create a [Resin.io](https://resin.io) application

Add the Resin.io remote url to your project

```sh
git remote add resin git@git.resin.io:username/projectname.git
```

Push to Resin

```sh
git push resin
```

##Configuration

The application looks for ENV variables to display.

`DEFAULT_URL` - The url to display on all kiosks unless a machine
specific url is set. I haven't been able to succesfully change this remotely.

adding an environment variable called URL to the device does get picked up remotely though. 

`URL_<RESIN_DEVICE_UUID>` - Each resin device has a UUID. You can
specify a machine specific url using this variable format
